# CubeeTS
Cubee is a UI Framework written in TypeScript. Cubee is a JavaFX like UI API which has the following key features.
- Data binding
- Timeline animations
- Component system (easy custom component and composit creation)
- Redesigned layout system (overlapping components and vertical alignment is not a problem anymore)
- HTML and CSS free (you don't need to write HTML or stuck with CSS to create your cutting edge UI)
